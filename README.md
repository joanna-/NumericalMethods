# Numerical Methods

This project contains implementation of few popular numerical methods. Each package contains method realted to its title.
The "examples" package contains examples of usage of the all methods implemented. Some of examples use matplotlib library in order
to visualize the results using 2D and 3D plots.

The topics includes: linear equations, nonlinear equations, differential equations, splines, approximation, matrix operations.
